- [x] Work on the translator

**Week 3 Summary (5 hours):**
- Tuesday: Attended weekly meeting with Aarti, attended weekly meeting with William and/or Prof. Bultan (5 hours)
- Thursday: Attended weekly group meeting, worked on the translator (2 hours)

**Thursday, January 23 (2 hours):**
- Attended weekly group meeting
  - We discussed how to implement a regular expression evaluator using an AST
  - We experimented with Z3str3 functions such as str.++, str.len, re.*, re.+, re.union, and re.range, all of which would help us form assertions to check complex regular expressions. 
  - We maintained our progress on the board
- Worked on the translator
  - I implemented a basic regular expression translator that broke down regular expressions into atomic components (strings and variables) and performed a bunch of concatenations to find a solution for the entire regular expression.

**Tuesday, January 21 (3 hours):**
- Attended weekly meeting with Aarti
  - Slides can be found here.
- Attended weekly meeting with William and/or Prof. Bultan
  - We discussed the visitor pattern in the context of evaluating regular expressions and conditions
  - We debated whether to be general or specific in our tree traversal
  - Meeting notes can be found here.
