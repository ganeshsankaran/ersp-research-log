**Goals:**
- [x] Attend research group meeting
- [x] Read “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” 

**Other Accomplishments:**
- Discussed project logistics with Prof. Bultan and Prof. Mirza

**Week 3 Summary (3.5 hours):**
- Friday: Discussed project logistics with Prof. Bultan and Prof. Mirza (0.5 hours)
- Monday: Read “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT”  (1 hour)
- Wednesday: Attended research group meeting (2 hours)

**Wednesday, October 16 (2 hours):**
- Attended research group meeting
  - We addressed how to evaluate the satisfiability and complexity of logic formulas fed into the SMT solver.
  - We discussed “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” 
  - We reviewed propositional logic and tree traversal with an emphasis on abstract syntax trees.
  - Meeting notes can be found here.

**Monday, October 14 (1 hour):**
- Read “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” 
  - I read about AWS’ IAM policy language and read about how ZELKOVA interprets policies logically to check access control policies.
  - Reading notes can be found here.

**Friday, October 11 (0.5 hours):**
- Discussed project logistics with Prof. Bultan and Prof. Mirza
  - Albert and I discussed how to evaluate the satisfiability and complexity of the logic formula that we construct from IAM policies with Prof. Bultan.
  - Albert and I checked in with Prof. Mirza regarding how our research problem and proposal would evolve over the course of ERSP.
