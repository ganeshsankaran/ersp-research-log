**Friday, December 13 (1 hour):**
- Wrote letter to my past self
  - Hello! I began writing this message upon finishing the third draft of my group’s research proposal. You are probably thinking that it’s difficult to write a research proposal in three months given the fact that you have little to no research experience. Well, you’re right. When I was in your place, I did not realize how radically different CS190N and ERSP were going to be from a traditional CS class. This entire program is focused on immersing yourself in research, which is definitely no easy feat. Rather than being taught the relevant material, you hunt to learn. Rather than turning in homeworks for the enjoyment of a professor, you complete assignments for the sake of mastering your own research project. ERSP is definitely what you make of it--the idea of doing real research still scares me, but what I’ve learned is that as long as you are passionate about what you are doing and you know who to reach out to when things don’t go so well, you will enjoy the hard work. Of course, your project may end up being a failure or you may end up not making any progress, but that’s the nature of research. There’s nothing I can tell you that would give you an edge in ERSP. That’s something that you have to discover yourself. With that, I wish you the best for the upcoming quarter and ERSP.
- Wrote letter to my future self
  - Hello! I began writing this message upon finishing the third draft of my group’s research proposal. I don’t know how you are feeling about your project and ERSP at the moment, but right now, I feel like I am at the highest point of a roller coaster ride. This quarter has been about learning the material relevant to my field and my project as well as about planning the logistics for the remainder of ERSP. I now know more about access control in the cloud, how to reason about the permissiveness of access control policies, boolean satisfiability and SMT, and tree traversal algorithms. Now it is time to apply this knowledge and actually come up with the proposed tool. This is not like a programming assignment where you know exactly what steps you have to take and what to deliver for a good grade. Sometimes, I still feel like I have no idea what our project is and I feel like we’re not going to be able to deliver such a project in just two more quarters. However, I have so much faith in my research group and my mentors, and I look forward to working with them. I can’t say whether ERSP was worth it at the moment, but I certainly hope I can when I’m in your place. With that, I wish you the best for your future endeavors.

**Thursday, December 12 (4 hours):**
- Revised research proposal draft
  - We made some of the proposal more concise and broke up complex sentences into simpler, coherent ones
  - We added figures to our Overleaf document
  - The completed research proposal draft can be found here.

**Monday, December 9 (2 hours):**
- Revised research proposal draft
  - We thoroughly analyzed Prof. Mirza and Aarti’s feedback
  - We came up with a list of proposed changes and assigned priorities to each of these changes so that we could achieve a middle ground between Prof. Mirza and Aarti’s expectations and Prof. Bultan and William’s expectations.
  - We divided up tasks so that we could work around our individual finals schedules.
  - Our proposed changes can be found here.
