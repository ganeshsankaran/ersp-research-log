# Fall Week 4 (October 17 - October 23)

**Goals:**
- [x] Attend research group meeting
- [x] Reread “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT”
- [x] Present “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” to peers
- [x] Choose teaching topic
- [x] Teach topic to a peer

**Week 4 Summary (6 hours):**
- Friday: Reread “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” (1 hour)
- Monday: Attended research group meeting (1 hour)
- Tuesday: Chose teaching topic (1 hour)
- Wednesday: Attended research group meeting; taught topic to a peer (3 hours)

**Wednesday, October 23 (3 hours):**
- Attended research group meeting
  - We discussed S-expressions and the SMT-LIB standard. 
  - We brainstormed questions for our upcoming research proposal.
  - We identified our research topics, what we could learn in these topics, and how we could apply these topics to our research and project
  - Meeting notes can be found here.
- Taught topic to a peer
  - Albert taught me about JSON and how to parse JSON documents using the json library for Python
  - I gave Albert a high-level overview of trees and graphs, how to traverse them, and common algorithms and data structures used to perform these 

**Tuesday, October 22 (1 hour):**
- Chose teaching topic
  - I chose to investigate tree traversal algorithms because this topic is something I am somewhat familiar with: I’ve learned depth-first traversals (such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals) and breadth-first traversals. In addition, I know that understanding these algorithms is important not only to the development of our project but also for interviews and other projects.

**Monday, October 21 (1 hour):**
- Attended research group meeting
  - We distributed and prepared relevant material in anticipation of our 3-minute presentation.
- Presented “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” to my peers
  - The presentation can be found here.
  
**Friday, October 16 (1 hour):**
- Reread “Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT” 
  - I reread this paper, considering Prof. Griswold’s guiding questions. Reading notes can be found here.
