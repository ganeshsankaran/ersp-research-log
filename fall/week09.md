- [x] Revise research proposal draft

**Week 9 Summary (5 hours):**
- Sunday: Revised research proposal draft (3 hours)
- Tuesday: Attended research group meeting; interviewed a grad student (2 hours)

**Tuesday, November 26 (2 hours):**
- Attended research group meeting
  - William gave us some feedback regarding the second draft of our research proposal.
  - We also used this time to conduct a round-robin style interview of William
- Interviewed a grad student
  - I learned a lot about William that I believe strengthens our relationship as mentor and mentee. First, William highlighted his passion for teaching and contributing to a body of knowledge; he mentioned that he spent a lot of time figuring out that he wanted to be a professor and do research. These passions are very similar to my own. I wanted to be at the forefront of CS research, which is why I decided to apply for and participate in ERSP. Second, William also emphasized the importance of having a PhD advisor who is like a “father figure.” Based on this advice, I want to continue developing my relationships with faculty members so that I will be better suited to work with them. The most surprising thing I learned was that William’s interest in working with the VLab stems from his OCD; he always probes how we can prove that something is secure and works as intended. I learned that is definitely a CS topic that anyone can relate to; for example, I want to make sure that my car is working before I take it for a ride. Overall, the graduate experience is no more nor less mysterious to me--it seems that the field I am working on, the people I am working with, the school I am at, and my personal circumstances may make or break my graduate experience.

**Sunday, November 24 (3 hours):**
- Revised research proposal draft
  - During our meeting, we consolidated all of our feedback from Prof. Bultan, William, and our peer reviewers. We came up with an action plan for revisions over the course of the day.
  - I revised the evaluation plan and timeline section. I made sure to point out the fundamental weakness that we won’t really be able to get a good sample of policies to use as test cases. This seems out of our hands so it seems like something we should bring up with Prof. Mirza.
  - The completed, revised research proposal draft can be found here.
