**Sunday, May 10 (1 hour):**

**Friday, May 8 (2.5 hours):**
- Attended weekly group meeting
- Prepared poster
  - We picked a theme, laid out the sections, and finished drafting the entire first column
  - Our to-do items include formalizing the flowchart for the approach and finding out how to trim down the graphs

**Wednesday, May 6 (1.5 hours):**
- Attended weekly meeting with William and/or Prof. Bultan
  - We discussed several topics pertaining to “Quacky” and the poster
  - To demonstrate the correctness of “Quacky,” we need to enumerate the models for a policy. Since ABC doesn’t output models and Z3 is very slow, we will have to create simple policies with subtle flaws (like the OG policies)
  - To document “Quacky,” we need to put comments, describe what “knobs” we can turn to get different results, and list restrictions and assumptions
  - For our poster, we are going to finalize how many/which graphs to include, how much space to allocate to detail our approach, and how to discuss type constraints, all while targeting a general CS audience
- Prepared poster

**Tuesday, May 5 (1.5 hours):**
